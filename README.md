Understood — this is a **GitHub Profile README**, not a project README.
Below is a **clean, professional, portfolio-grade `README.md`** you can place directly in a repository named **`KarthikP47`** (GitHub uses that to render your profile).

It is **resume-aligned**, recruiter-friendly, and avoids sensitive details.
